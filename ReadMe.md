# 2.4 HTML Tags w/ Attributes Guided Practice 

## Part One

### Watch and Code Along (5 min):

1. Let's put the name of someone's favorite movie inside of an `<a>` tag. Write out the `<a>` tag including the `<href>`. Then as the text content, put the title of favorite movie of someone in the class. Don't worry about the link for now! 

2. Now I'm going to demo linking the IMDB or Wikipedia page for the first movie inside of our `<a>`tag. I want it to be so that when the user clicks the movie title, they are brought to this webpage. Please code along as I demo!

3. Let's add another person's favorite movie by making another `<a>` tag. For this movie, I want someone to help me. Take me through the steps to write the `<a>` tag and then add the link to it. 

### Code It Solo!(3 minutes):

3. Creat an `<a>` tag that links to YOUR favorite movie. Make sure that the text content is the title of the movie, and that user is brought to the movie's website when they click this title. If you have time, do a fourth one! 

## Part Two
### Watch and Code Along (3 min):

1. Now let's add some images of the movies.  Can someone volunteer to help take me through how we would make an `<img>` tag for the first move on the list? Feel free to look at your notes or the slides! 

### Code It Solo (5 min):
2. Now add `<img>` tags for the other two movies on the list.

### Spicy Challenge (If you finish early):
Open up the CSS tab. Can you figure out how to change the size of the images? For a hint, check out lines 3-5 of the CSS. What number do you think you'd need to change here?
